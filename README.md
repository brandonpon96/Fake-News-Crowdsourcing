Did you have a hard time? It's nearly impossible to tell the difference between fake news and real events, especially with topics that are emotional or triggering. Gun Violence and shootings is just our example to show how easy it is to be misinformed and develop polarizing opinions. Remember to keep yourself educated from reliable sources and stay away from click-bait articles and social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter.
